STL Game Dev Arcade is an open source package of games made by members of the Saint Louis, Missouri Game Development Community ([stlgamedev.com](http://stlgamedev.com)). It is designed to be a coherent system that anyone can contribute to, and which can be configured to run on virtually any system, easily.

This project is just getting started. Check the [wiki](https://github.com/SeiferTim/STLGameDevArcade/wiki) for more details.
